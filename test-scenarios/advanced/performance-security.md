# Performance and Security Test

## Test Objective
Evaluate website performance, security headers, and potential vulnerabilities.

## Test Scenarios

### Performance Testing
- Measure page load times for key pages
- Test Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Check for render-blocking resources
- Verify image optimization and lazy loading
- Test caching effectiveness
- Monitor memory usage and resource consumption

### Security Headers
- Check for Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Verify X-Frame-Options header
- Test X-Content-Type-Options header
- Check Strict-Transport-Security header
- Verify Referrer-Policy header
- Test X-XSS-Protection header

### Input Security
- Test for XSS vulnerabilities in forms
- Check for SQL injection possibilities
- Test CSRF protection on forms
- Verify input sanitization
- Test file upload security (if applicable)
- Check for clickjacking protection

### Authentication Security
- Test password strength requirements
- Verify secure session management
- Check for account lockout mechanisms
- Test password reset functionality
- Verify secure cookie settings
- Test multi-factor authentication (if applicable)

### Network Security
- Verify HTTPS implementation
- Check SSL/TLS certificate validity
- Test for mixed content issues
- Verify secure API endpoints
- Check for information disclosure
- Test for directory traversal vulnerabilities

### Data Protection
- Verify sensitive data handling
- Check for data leakage in responses
- Test privacy policy compliance
- Verify GDPR compliance (if applicable)
- Check for PII exposure
- Test data encryption in transit

## Success Criteria
- Page load times under 3 seconds
- Core Web Vitals meet Google's thresholds
- All security headers properly configured
- No critical security vulnerabilities found
- Authentication mechanisms are secure
- Data protection measures are effective

## Notes
This is an advanced test requiring security and performance expertise. Some tests may require specialized tools or manual verification.
